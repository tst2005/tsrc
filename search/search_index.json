Preliminary GitHub support \u00b6 Added support for creating merge requests on GitHub. No configuration required. Just make sure you are using tsrc from a repository which has a URL starting with git@github.com . tsrc will prompt you once for your login and password and then store an API token. Afterwards, you'll be able to use tsrc push to: Create a pull request (or update it if it already exists) Assign people to the request (with the -a/--assignee option) Request reviewers (with the --reviewers option) Merge the pull request (with the --merge option) This change has no impact if you were already using GitLab . tsrc push : new features and bug fixes \u00b6 Add --close option. Breaking change : -m/--message option is gone, use --title instead. There's a concept of \"description\" or \"message\" for pull requests and merge requests, but the value of the option was only used to update the title , so it had to be renamed. Do not assume local and remote tracking branch have the same name. Allow using tsrc push <local>:<remote> to explicitly specify local and remote branch names. Fix bugs when target is not specified on the command line. See this commit for details. Fix missing merge requests in tsrc push (see issue #80 ). Patch by @maximerety. Improve fixed reference handling \u00b6 Breaking change : Instead of using fixed_ref in the manifest, you should now use tag or sha1 : old : repos: - src: git@example.com/foo fixed_ref: 42a70 new : repos: - src: git@example.com/foo tag: v0.1 See the dedicated section about manifest format and the #57 pull request discussion for the details. This allow us to implement different behaviors depending on whether or not the fixed ref is a tag or just a sha1. Support for shallow clones \u00b6 To save time and space, you can use tsrc init --shallow to only have shallow clones in your workspace. Note that due to limitations in git itself, the shallow option cannot be used with a fixed SHA1. If you need this, prefer using a tag instead. Misc \u00b6 Organization TankerApp was renamed to SuperTanker . New urls are: github.com/SuperTanker/tsrc for the git repository supertanker.github.io/tsrc for the documentation We now use pipenv for dependency handling. v0.3.2 (2017-11-02) \u00b6 Improve tsrc status to handle tags. Patch by @arnaudgelas. Fix crash when running tsrc version . v0.3.1 (2017-10-06) \u00b6 Improve tsrc status output. Now also shows number of commits ahead and behind, and display a short SHA-1 when not on any branch. Initial patch by @arnaudgelas. v0.3.0 (2017-09-22) \u00b6 Breaking change : Add support for groups (#30). Reported by @arnaudgelas. See the dedicated section about manifest format for details.

Doc strings and comments \u00b6 First off, bad comments are worse that no comments. Also note that you should use comments to explain why , never what . If the what is no clear, it means the behavior of the function or method cannot be easily understood by reading implementation, and so you should fix the implementation instead. In conclusion, use comments and doc strings sparingly: that way, they will not rot and they will stay useful. Collections \u00b6 Use .extend() instead of += to concatenate lists: # Yes list_1.extend(list_2) # No list_1 += list_2 Use explicit methods to initialize lists and dictionaries. The code is more readable, and you have to use set() to initialize sets anyway: # Yes my_list = list() my_dict = dict() # No my_list = [] my_dict = {} Also use explicit call to list() in order to make a copy: # Yes my_copy = list(my_list) # Also yes: my_copy = copy.copy(my_list) # No my_copy = my_list[:] Use list comprehensions instead of loops and \"functional\" methods: # Yes my_list = [foo(x) for x in other_list] # No my_list = list() for x in other_list: x.append(foo(x)) # Also no my_list = map(foo, other_list) # Yes even_nums = [x for x in nums if is_even(x)] # No even_nums = filter(is_even, nums) Use iterable syntax instead of building an explicit list: # Yes max(len(x) for x in myiterable) # No max([len(x) for x in myiterable]) Use plural names for collections.

If you use the last form, Python will let you use foo(42, False) , and set spam to False. This can cause problems if someone ever changes the foo function and adds a new optional argument before spam : def foo(bar, eggs=False, spam=Tue): ... After such a change, the line foo(42, False) which used to call foo with spam=False now calls foo with bar=False and spam=True , leading to all kinds of interesting bugs. Exception to this rule: when the keyword is obvious and will not change: def get(value, default=None): ... Imports \u00b6 For any foo.py file, import foo must never fail, unless there is a necessary module that could not be found.

Importing Python files should never cause side effects. It's OK to initialize global variables, but you should never call functions outside a if __name__ == main() block . Prefer using fully-qualified imports and names: # Yes import foo.bar my_bar = foo.bar.Bar() # No from foo import bar my_bar = bar.Bar() Note We allow a few exceptions like from path import Path or importing classes directory in tests. Use your best judgement. Classes \u00b6 When you want to make sure a class follows an interface, use abc.ABCMeta instead of raising NotImplementedError . This way you get the error when the class is instantiated instead of when the method is called. # Yes class AbstractFoo(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta): @abc.abstractmethod def foo(self): pass # No class AbstractFoo: def foo(self): raise NotImplementedError() Make sure to use properties when relevant, instead of get_ methods. # Yes class Person: def __init__(self, first_name, last_name): self.first_name = first_name self.last_name = last_name @property def full_name(self): return \"{} {}\".format(self.first_name, self.last_name) # No: class Foo: def __init__(self, first_name, last_name): self.first_name = first_name self.last_name = last_name self.full_name = \"{} {}\".format(self.first_name, self.last_name) For instance, here: full_name is read-only The attribute is automatically updated if first_name changes after the object is initialized. Note that get_ methods are OK if they do more than simple computations (expensive in time or size, throwing exceptions ...) File paths \u00b6 If you are manipulating filenames, use the path.py library and suffix the variable by _path .

Plus Python2.7 supports ends in 2020 . Why not repo? \u00b6 We used repo for a while, but found that tsrc had both a better command line API and a nicer output. On a less subjective level: Good support for Windows (no need for CygWin or anything like that) GitLab support (automate working with merge requests) Lastly, tsrc tries hard to never do any destructive operation or unexpected actions. For instance, tsrc never puts you in a \"detached HEAD\" state, nor does automatic rebases. It also never touches dirty repos. This is achieved by using mostly 'porcelain' commands from git, instead of relying on plumbings internals. Also (and this matters a lot if you think about contribution): Comprehensive test suite Uses PEP8 coding style Written in Python 3, not Python 2 Here are a few features present in repo that are missing from tsrc (but may be implemented in the future) Cloning several repositories in parallel Support for other hosting services such as gerrit or github Why not git-subrepo, mu-repo, or gr? \u00b6 All this projects are fine but did not match our needs: git-subrepo squashes commits, and we prefer having normal clones everywhere. mu-repo is nice and contains an interesting dependency management feature, but currently we do not need this complexity. In any case, now that the whole team is using tsrc all the time, it's likely we'll keep using tsrc in the future. Why not git submodule? \u00b6 It's all about workflow. With git-submodule , you have a 'parent' repository and you freeze the state of the 'children' repositories to a specific commit. It's useful when you want to re-build a library you've forked when you build your main project, or when you have a library or build tools you want to factorize across repositories: this means that each 'parent' repository can have its children on any commit they want. With tsrc , all repositories are equal, and what you do instead is to make sure all the branches (or tags) are consistent across repositories. For instance, if you have foo and bar , you are going to make sure the 'master' branch of foo is always compatible to the 'master' branch of bar . Or if you want to go back to the state of the '0.42' release, you will run: tsrc foreach -- git reset --hard v0.42 . Note that since tsrc 0.2 you can also freeze the commits of some of the repositories. Last but not least, with tsrc you do everything with tsrc init and tsrc sync , which is a simpler command line API than git submodule . Why not using libgit2 or similar? \u00b6 pygit2 now has pre-built wheels for Windows, but not for macOS and Linux. We prefer to not require compiling libgit2 . Also, we prefer calling git \"porcelain\" commands, both for readability of the source code and ease of debugging. Why do you hide which git commands are run? \u00b6 It's mainly a matter of not cluttering the output. We take care of keeping the output of tsrc both concise, readable and informative. That being said: In case a git command fails, we'll display the full command that was run. If you still need to see all the git commands that are run, we provide a --verbose flag, like so: tsrc --verbose sync Why argparse? \u00b6 See docopt v argparse , and please don't use click . Why YAML? \u00b6 It's nice to read and write, and we use the excellent ruamel.yaml which even has round-trip support.
